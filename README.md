We believe every body should either have a Multisig or Hardwallet. Good hardware wallets are quite pricey and multisig are quite confusing, Lunchbox enables users to benefit from the 
security of a multisig while being as easy to use as any other crypto wallet even better. We also feature Spending Limit and account locks where a user arbitrarily if they feel funny businesss is going on. The 2/3 multilsig is a very optimal choice for day to day transaction and if the user ever was compromised they can remove the compromised key and generate a new one without changing their "Public address". Lunchbox is commited to expanding the use cases of Multisig wallets. The hyperdrive hackathon has but this is just the beginning for us.
